               f"1. The most popular use cases for Utility:\n"
               f" - For GPU diagnostics run 'python3 diagnostics.py --filter gpu'\n"
               f" - To get all information run 'python3 diagnostics.py --filter all'\n"

               f"   Please, read all failures\\infos and combine it in one bird eye view\n"
               f"   - Output may have different format in case of using verbose mode\n"
